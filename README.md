# password-maker

In this assignment, I utilized Javascript code to create an application that based on prompts would create a random password. 

First, I generated prompts asking for the desired password length, as well as whether the user wanted to use lowercase, uppercase, numerical and special characters for the generated password.  

Once determined, a function would utilize the answers from the character prompts to create a string of potential characters for a for loop to iterate over.  

A for loop would then iterate over the created string to randomly select characters equal to the desired password length.  

Once the for loop completed its iterations, the function returns a generated password that would be transferred from within the Javascript code to a generate button within the HTML.
